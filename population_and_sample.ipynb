        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The population refers to the entire group of individuals or items that we are interested in studying and drawing conclusions about. In statistics, the population is the entire set of items from which data is drawn in the statistical study. It can be a group of individuals or a set of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "The population is usually denoted by N.\n",
        "\n",
        "A sample is a subset of the population selected for study. It is a representative portion of the population from which we collect data in order to make inferences or draw conclusions about the entire population.\n",

        "A sample is a subset of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Collecting data from an entire population can be time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes impractical or impossible.\n",

        "Collecting Data From Population and Sample\n",
        "Populations are used when your research question requires, or when you have access to, data from every member of the population. Usually, it is only straightforward to collect data from a whole population when it is small, accessible and cooperative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "A marketing manager for a small local bakery wants to understand customer preferences for different types of bread sold at their shop. Since they are solely interested in analyzing the preferences of customers who visit their bakery, they decide to collect data on bread preferences from every customer who makes a purchase over the course of a month. By using the entire dataset of bread purchases, including preferences indicated by customers, they aim to identify trends and patterns in bread choices specifically among their bakery’s clientele.\n",
        "\n",
        "When your population is large in size, geographically dispersed, or difficult to contact, it’s necessary to use a sample. With statistical analysis, you can use sample data to make estimates or test hypotheses about population data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you are conducting research on smartphone usage habits among teenagers in a specific city. Your population comprises all teenagers aged 13-18 living in that city, which could number in the tens of thousands. Due to logistical constraints and the difficulty of reaching every teenager in the city, you opt to use a sample of 500 teenagers randomly selected from different schools within the city. This sample will participate in interviews or surveys to provide insights into their smartphone usage patterns, preferences, and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Should Samples be used?\n",
        "When studying a large population where it is impractical or impossible to collect data from every individual.\n",
        "When resources such as time, cost, and manpower are limited, making it more feasible to collect data from a subset of the population.\n",
        "When conducting research or experiments where it is important to minimize potential biases in data collection.\n"
