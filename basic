When Should Samples be used?
When studying a large population where it is impractical or impossible to collect data from every individual.
When resources such as time, cost, and manpower are limited, making it more feasible to collect data from a subset of the population.
When conducting research or experiments where it is important to minimize potential biases in data collection.
